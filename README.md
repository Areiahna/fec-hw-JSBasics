"# fec-hw-JSBasics" 

student.JS
---------------------
The objective of this assignment was to grasp the concept of data types in 
JavaScript and practice working with different types of data.

I created variables for student's:
name - studentName
age - studentAge
grade - studentGrade
attendance status - attendanceStatus

I logged student info into the console using concatenation


operations.js
---------------------
The objective of this assignment was to use different types of operators in JS.
First I created functions to get the value of 2 numbers by using:
addition - sum()
subtraction - difference()
multiplication - product()
division - quotient()

Next, I used comparison operators to determine if the numbers were equal, 
greater than or not equal to each other.

Last, I created functions to determine if:
both numbers are positive - isPositive()
atleast one number is even - isEven()
